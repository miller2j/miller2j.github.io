The Statistical Institute of Jamaica (**STATIN**) was established under the Statistics (Amendment) Act 1984 on April 9, 1984. The Institute has been invested with all the powers formerly vested in the Department of Statistics and previously the Bureau of Statistics (which came into existence in 1946). The Statistical Institute of Jamaica is an agency of the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service.

The main functions of the Institute are:

*   to collect, compile, analyse, abstract and publish statistical information relating to the commercial, industrial, social, economic and general activities and condition of the people;
*   to collaborate with public agencies in the collection, compilation and publication of statistical information including statistical information derived from the activities of such agencies;
*   to take any census in Jamaica; and generally to promote and develop integrated social and economic statistics pertaining to Jamaica and to co-ordinate programmes for the integration of such statistics, in accordance with the provisions of the Statistics Act.
